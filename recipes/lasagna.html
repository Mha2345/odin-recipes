   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>Lasagna is an italian dish that is aboslutely delicious!  It is basically pasta, tomato sauce, and cheese.  But it is made in a way that you might not expect.  In other words, it's not spaghetti!</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong> 1/2 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong> Two tablespoons of parsley, one clove of garlic</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> A dash of sugar</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings</strong> Dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles</strong> Lasagna noodles/li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong> Cottage cheese and parmesan</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong></li>
     </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>    
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>

   </ul>
